<p align="center">
One of the best ways to learn is to just jump in and try! The challenge was to the best of my current ability, recreate the BBC website landing page and the first thing you see. The goal is to learn as much as I can from the these challenges and record progress! Will continue to update as I learn new tools and techniques.

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html and CSS

### Html

The Html, although seemingly simple, required proper attention. As to not make any mistakes and issues later for the CSS portion, I was careful to be clean and accurate. I wanted to make sure to group my sections, classes and ids to make sure there wasn't any confusion. Worst part of it was, coming up with the class and id names! But as I got into the groove, it became a pattern. I used section instead of div, except for in a couple areas. This helped me figure out the segments and their placements.


### CSS

The CSS was very rewarding once I figured out the flow! 
There was some lessons to be learned here. Including with `floats` and `positioning` for example. The CSS definitely needed to be sectioned up and focused on. Floats were not difficult, but `Flexbox` or `Grid` would've been my preferred. 


## Styling Effects

The BBC website navigation bar was simple to float, though figuring out the search bar and Logo placement took a bit of time. I applied its effect of color switching depending on which tab you were floating over. Finding the matching colors was quick and I am content with the results!

### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&emsp;More Hover Effects

The websites links and pictures also had effects that I needed to duplicate. I also wanted the pictures to appear a little darker before I applied some layered opacity. Some text required an underline hover, as well as, change in color. This part was fun to do!

# &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;What I Learned

### HTML and CSS Organization

This section is a given and self explanatory, but so important! I learned to be more careful with "keywords" in class names and ids. Structure is also crucial. Making sure the code was better organized and indented properly was important. This kept me on track better than before.

### ::before & ::after

I learned about these selectors and how to use them. Although only using the `::before` in my css, I see why they're useful and how they are used! 

### Combinators

I learned more about these types of selectors and when they are used. I Mostly used the `child combinator >` and with it, I was able to select many elements at once. Really helped trim down my CSS.
