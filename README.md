# BBC Website
One of the best ways to learn is to just jump in and try! The goal was, to the best of my current ability, recreate the BBC website and learn as much as I can from the challenge! Will continue to update as I learn new tools and techniques.

## How Its Made 

->**Languages used:** Html and CSS<-

### Html

The Html portion, although seemingly simple, required proper attention.
As to not make any mistakes and issues later for the CSS portion, I was careful to be clean and accurate. 
I wanted to make sure to group my sections, classes and ids to make sure there wasn't any confusion. 
Worst part of it was, coming up with the class and id names! But as I got into the groove, it became a pattern. 
I used section instead of div, except for in a couple areas. 
This helped me figure out the segments and their placements.


### CSS

The CSS portion was definitely frustrating at times, but very rewarding once I figured out some techniques! 
There was a lot to be learned here and learn I did. 
The CSS definitely needed to be sectioned up and focused on. 
Floats were not as bad as I thought they would have been, but Flexbox or Grid would've been my preferred.
