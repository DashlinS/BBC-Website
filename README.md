# BBC Website
Best way to learn is to jump in and try! The goal was, to the best of my current ability, recreate the BBC website and learn as much as I can from the challenge! Will continue to update as I learn new tools and techniques.

## How Its Made 

**Languages used:** Html and CSS

### Html
```
The Html portion, although seemingly simple, required proper attention. As to not make any mistakes and issues later for the CSS portion, I was careful to be clean and accurate. I wanted to make sure to group my sections, classes and ids to make sure there wasn't any confusion. Worst part of it is, coming up with the class and id names! As I got into the groove, it became a pattern. I went ahead and used all sections instead of divs, except for a couple areas. This helped me figure out the segments and their placements.
```
### CSS
```
Definitely frustrating at times, but very rewarding once you get the hang of it or figure it out! There was a lot to be learned here and that I did. The CSS definitely needed to be sectioned up and focused on. Floats were not as bad as I thought they would have been, but Flexbox or Grid would've been my preferred.
